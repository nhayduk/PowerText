Based on the Auto Text Expander by carlinyuen (https://github.com/carlinyuen/ChromeAutoTextExpander), Power Text is a Google Chrome Extension that allows you to define text shortcuts.

This version has been expanded to support pulling information from a Power Apps model-driven form.

Use the %mda\(attribute_logical_name\[,fallback_attribute_logical_name ...\]\) tag to insert a value on a model-driven form in Microsoft Power Apps. Includes supports for text fields, lookups, option sets and date/times.
